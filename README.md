# Knowing-MLPs-Pytorch-Implementation

This repository contains a jupyter notebook named Knowing-MLP's.ipynb which contains implementation
of MLP's using Pytorch along with various experiments.

Here, we will be working with MNIST dataset to explore the importance of different MLP compoenents.
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images. Our goal is to use an MLP to classify these images into one of the 10 categories(0-9).

## Tasks Performed
1. Implementation of MLP using Pytorch
2. Experimentation with different optimization algorithms:
    a) Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)
    b) SGD with Momentum
    c) SGD with L2 Optimizer
    d) Adam Optimizer
    e) RMS Prop
3. Experimentation with Multiplicative and Multistep Schedulers
4. Defining new 3 models by adding :
   a) Batch Normalisation
   b) Dropout
   c) Adding both
5. Mini_Batch VS Stochastic


Every task mentioned above has been highlighted in the notebook and various graphs have been drawn for comparisons.
Also, understanding from various comparisons have been mentioned in the notebook itself.
